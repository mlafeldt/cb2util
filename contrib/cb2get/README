Welcome to cb2get, the CodeBreaker PS2 Download Script!


---============---
   Version history
---===============---

v1.51 (Aug 8 2008)
* The script is public again. :)
* Removed dos2unix dependency.

v1.5 (Feb 25 2008) [Private Build]
* The script's output is much more readable now.
+ Added a check to see if a file has already been downloaded and is up to date.
* Minor other changes to the script.

v1.3 (Jul 16 2007) [Private Build]
* First off, a correction: Any changes applied to CMGSCCC's download system
  (CAPTCHAs, limit) did NOT affect the CodeBreaker's download capability.
  Actually, the website simply checks the HTTP header of requests to decide
  whether it came from a CB or not. With the CB, you can download as many files
  as you wish. Otherwise, if you use a browser, you are limited to 10 downloads
  per day and have to pass CAPTCHA tests.

  Using netcat, I was able to sniff the CodeBreaker's HTTP request:
        listening on [any] 80 ...
        connect to [192.168.0.2] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.0.10] 4145
        GET /ps2/day1/cb.php?date=2005-07-22 HTTP/1.0
        Host: www.cmgsccc.com
        User-Agent: PS2NET Client
  I adapted my download script accordingly and it's working again. ;)

  However, this is a private build. I guess this cat-and-mouse game will
  continue until CMGSCCC actually disables the CB's download functionality. This
  is not my intention; there will be no public release of v1.3.
  The whole project is a good example of what happens, if security isn't
  designed into a system from the bottom up. After all, the security policy of
  CMGSCCC is a total failure.
* This version is covered by the GPLv3.

v1.2 (Feb 16 2007)
* Next round: They have added a check to verify that HTTP requests are coming
  from their website and not from other places like this download script.
  This is a stupid way to check something so easily forged. Using curl, you can
  put anything you want in the referer-field and thus be able to fool the
  server into serving your request.
* And by the way, CM, thanks for banning me from your website. This is almost as
  ineffective as your last fix above. You'd rather do something about the popup
  malware (EXP/Agent.B) on your forums.

v1.1 (Feb 12 2007)
* Looks like my download script has caught the attention of CMGSCCC, as they
  have taken steps against it. Actually, I expected this to happen.
    What they did was to completely remove the index files from the site, e.g.
  http://www.cmgsccc.com/ps2/day1/cb.php is now empty. Further, you can't
  download anything (Day1 files, etc.) without being logged into the site.
    These countermeasures do not only mean that my original script doesn't work
  anymore, it also disables the download feature of the CodeBreaker cheat device
  itself. Very clever...
    However, version 1.1 fixes the issues. I came up with another solution which
  isn't as comfortable as the original one, but it works!
+ Added the possibility to download PSP Game Saves (*.pms).
+ Added this readme.

v1.0 (Jan 23 2007)
* Initial public release

   About cb2get
---============---

Briefly, cb2get is a shell script. What this script does is to download *all*
available Day1 Code Saves, Game Saves, and Firmware Updates for CodeBreaker PS2
from the CMGSCCC website to your computer.


---==---
   Usage
---=====---

To execute the script, you'll need Linux or a Linux-like environment like
Cygwin on Windows. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you're
probably used to Windows and should at least visit http://www.cygwin.com/ or
install a better OS. ;)

After starting the script, cb2get will create three folders, "day1", "saves",
and "updates", and put the respective files and an index.txt file with all IDs
and corresponding file names there.

That's it!
